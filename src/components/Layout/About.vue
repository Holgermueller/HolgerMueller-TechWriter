      I'm a full-stack front-end developer living in Minneapolis, MN.

    <p class="about-paragraph">
      The brain needs blood to function. Because of this, I exercise regularly.
      I'm an avid weight-lifter, making sure to focus on one muscle group a day,
      six days a week. A year ago, I set a personal best by deadlifting 350 lbs.
      I hope to lift 400 lbs. one day. I also make sure I get in at least a
      half-hour of cardio a day, 3-4 days a week. During the spring, summer, and
      fall, I'm an avid hiker, and I like to hike and be outdoors for about an
      hour.
