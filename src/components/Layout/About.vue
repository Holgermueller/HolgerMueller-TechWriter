    >The brain needs blood to function. Because of this, I exercise regularly. I'm an avid weight-lifter, making sure to focus on one muscle group a day, six days a week. A year ago, I set a personal best by deadlifting 350 lbs. I hope to lift 400 lbs. one day. I also make sure I get in at least a half-hour of cardio a day, 3-4 days a week. During the spring, summer, and fall, I'm an avid hiker, and I like to hike and be outdoors for about an hour a hike.</p>
